11.Unless explicitly silenced.
12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15.Now is better than never.
20.Beautiful is better than ugly.

26.Readability counts.

28.Although practicality beats purity.
